Fall Blau is a First-Person shooter designed and built within Unreal Engine 4, set during the invasion of the Soviet Union in 1943. It follows a german soldier from skirmishes on the soviet border to the depths of Stalingrad.

I started work on it in the summer of 2019, having realised that I needed to rebiild my previous project, All Out, from the ground up in order to get it working with the C++ systems I intended to implement. In that process I also decided to shrink the scope of All Out to come up with a completable game. 

I was responsible for the vast majority of Fall Blauâ€™s development, from writing the core gameplay mechanics in C++ to creating levels, cutscenes, art and other related assets for the project. A large amount of visual assets were sourced from the Unreal Engine marketplace and other marketplaces, such as cgtrader, as I underestimated the amount of assets that would be needed to complete such a project.
