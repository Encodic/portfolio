Fall Blau is a First-Person shooter designed and built within Unreal Engine 4, set during the invasion of the Soviet Union in 1943. It follows a german soldier from skirmishes on the soviet border to the depths of Stalingrad.

I started work on it in the summer of 2019, having realised that I needed to rebiild my previous project, All Out, from the ground up in order to get it working with the c++ systems I intended to implement. In that process I also decided to shrink the scope of All Out to come up with a completable game. I was responsible for the vast majority of Fall Blauâ€™s development, starting with the creation of mechanics for the player, and moving on to creating levels, cutscenes, art and other related assets for the project. A large amount of visual assets were sourced from the Unreal Engine marketplace and other marketplaces, such as cgtrader, as I underestimated the amount of assets that would be needed to complete such a project. Fall Blau taught me that if I wanted to make a game, I needed to plan things and make sure I could do them before I got to implementing them and wasting weeks of time.
